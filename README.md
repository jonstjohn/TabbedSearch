# Issue with tabbed search

I recently encountered an issue in a personal project where the view controller within a tab disappears when
UISearchController.

Here is the initial table view controller w/ search:

Focus on search:

Tap on first tab:

Tap back on tab with search, note missing view controller:

Tapping cancel removes search controller:
